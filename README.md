## COS30045 Data Visualisation Project - Explore data of enforcement on mobile phone use while driving fines and trends

This project is a interactive dashboard provides insights into mobile phone fines while driving across Australian jurisdictions. The three core visualizations allow you to:

1. Fines Trend Analysis - Track fine patterns over time, comparing jurisdictions and detection methods (cameras vs police). See how penalties have evolved annually across jurisdictions as well as nationwide.
2. 2023 Fine Demographics - Analyze mobile phone violation patterns across Australia with detailed data by age group and location. See which generations are most frequently penalized and how enforcement varies from state to state.
3. Geographic Hotspots - Explore heatmaps showing fine concentrations by location and age group. Identify high-risk areas and demographics.

Customize views using filters for time periods, locations, and enforcement types. The data helps drivers understand risks while assisting policymakers in evaluating road safety measures.
